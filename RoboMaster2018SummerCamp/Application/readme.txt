Running "Webb_duipai.bat" can automatically generate random samples input from "data_rand.exe" and compare the results of "Webb_t2.exe" and "std.exe" output.


"testdata.in" is the sample input given by the RoboMaster Organizing Committee. 
If you need to test this sample input provided by RMOC, please add "Webb_tn.cpp": 
freopen("testdata.in", "r", stdin);
freopen("testdata.out", "w", stdout);

"testdata.in" and "Webb_tn.exe" need to be placed in the same folder.
